# Week 2 ‚Äì BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

This repository contains the deliverables for **Week 2** of the BabySoC learning journey.  

## üéØ Objectives
The main goals of this week are:
- To gain a **solid conceptual understanding** of **System-on-Chip (SoC) fundamentals**.  
- To practice **functional modelling** of the BabySoC using open-source simulation tools like **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** and **GTKWave**.

## üèóÔ∏è Introduction to the VSDBabySoC
The **VSDBabySoC** is a **simplified, RISC-V based System-on-Chip (SoC)** created for educational and research purposes.  

### ‚ú® Key Highlights
- Built around the **RVMYTH RISC-V microprocessor** core.  
- Integrates an **8x Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** to generate a stable high-frequency clock.  
- Includes a **10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)** to interface with analog devices.  

The primary motivation for BabySoC is:
- To demonstrate **integration of multiple open-source IP cores** on a single SoC.  
- To provide a **minimal but functional SoC model** that learners can simulate and study before exploring more complex SoCs.  
- To **calibrate the analog components** in sync with the digital system.
